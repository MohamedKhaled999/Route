            <h1>Neverwinter</h1>
            <h3 class="">About Neverwinter</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re a fan of Dungeons and Dragons, have I got a game for
              you! Neverwinter, developed by Cryptic Studios and published by
              Perfect World Entertainment, is based on the critically acclaimed
              fantasy role playing game and the best part is ­ it’s free to
              play. In the world of Neverwinter, you will explore and defend one
              of the most beloved cities from the Dungeons and Dragons Forgotten
              Realms Campaign Setting, as it rises from the ashes of total
              destruction. In this totally immersive MMORPG you will go from the
              besieged walls of the city, to the subterranean passageways and
              search for forgotten secrets and lost treasure along the way.
              Neverwinter is completely free to play, from the very first level,
              all the way up to the level cap, so anyone is able to experience
              the engaging action and combat it brings. You don’t have to worry
              about tab­targeting or auto­attacking to defeat your enemies,
              Neverwinter provides an amazing combat experience where every
              action will require planning and feel visceral and look
              spectacular. Neverwinter also comes with Foundry, which is a
              dynamic tool set that will provide you with the game assets and a
              sandbox environment that will allow you to create your own
              adventures ­ and when you are ready to unveil your creation to the
              world ­ you are able to hook it up directly to the existing work
              so everyone else in the community can experience it as well!
              Whether you are familiar with Dungeons and Dragons from the
              tabletop game or from the novels, Neverwinter has recreated many
              of the iconic classes, locations and encounters that you will know
              and love! You might choose to go on an adventure as a mighty
              Guardian Fighter, choose to deceive foes as a Trickster Rogue, or
              follow the righteous path as a Devoted Cleric, but whatever
              journey you decide to take in Neverwinter you will face Kobolds,
              Beholders, Mimics and many other creatures from the Dungeons and
              Dragons universe, and you will surely feel right at home!

              this is a browser based game and should run smoothly on
              practically any PC with a updated web-browser. If you have old
              hardware or software, you may still be able to play the game
              , but your game experience may suffer. For the best
              gameplay experience, we recommend the latest versions of Firefox,
              Chrome, or Internet Explorer.
